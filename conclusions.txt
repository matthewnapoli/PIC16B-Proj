Completed my project of creating a basic trading simulator, some key points that came to mind creating it.

Takeaways:

-DATA IS SUPER IMPORTANT.
     The main factor that made our project low quality was the quality of data we used. We tried to use "Polygon.ai", it was actually terrible. We aimed to make a trading
     simulator that could handle minute-to-minute trading, but their data was pretty spotty, to say at the least. It ended up only working SOMEWHAT sufficiently for the stocks
     that Polygon aims to get the most data on (SPY, TSLA, AAPL). Super disappointed with the quality of minute-to-minute data, but lesson learned.
